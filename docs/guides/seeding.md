# Keeping hypers online (seeding)

```
hyp seed {url}
```

To sync the current data of a hyper and host its data for others to access, run the seed command on its URL:

```
hyp seed hyper://1234..af
```

You can stop seeding with the unseed command:

```
hyp unseed hyper://1234..af
```

You can list all currently-seeded hypers with the info command:

```
hyp info
```
