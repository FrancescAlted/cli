# Creating a hyperdrive

If you're just looking to share a folder, you can [use the sync command](./sharing-a-folder.md) to easily create a hyperdrive. It can still be useful to manually create hyperdrives, so here's how to do that.

```
hyp drive create
```

It will output the URL of your hyperdrive and you'll be ready to go!
